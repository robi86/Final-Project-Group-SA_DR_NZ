# Final-Project-Group-SA_DR_NZ

This repository contains codes used to implement a LeNet5 feedforward neural network architecture for a binary classification task using the NIH Chest X-ray database. In this project, we investigate the following: 
- How is performance affected by changes in training optimization algorithm? 
- How is performance affected by changes in distribution and types of transfer function?
- How is performance affected by changes in the size of convolution layer filters?  

In addition, our original project proposal and final project report can be found.
